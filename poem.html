<h1>Gathering Leaves</h1>

<h2>By: Robert Frost</h2>

<p>Spades take up leaves
    No better than spoons,
    And bags full of leaves
    Are light as balloons.</p>

<p>I make a great noise
    Of rustling all day
    Like rabbit and deer
    Running away.</p>

<p>But the mountains I raise
    Elude my embrace,
    Flowing over my arms
    And into my face.</p>

<p>I may load and unload
    Again and again
    Till I fill the whole shed,
    And what have I then?</p>

<p>Next to nothing for weight,
    And since they grew duller
    From contact with earth,
    Next to nothing for color.</p>

<p>Next to nothing for use,
    But a crop is a crop,
    And who’s to say where
    The harvest shall stop?</p>
